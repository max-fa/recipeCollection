					<h1>Dry Heat Cooking Methods</h1>
					<p>Dry Heat Cooking is a way of cooking in which the heat is <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> transported to the food through the medium of a liquid,but rather through heated air;enveloped by it in an oven or more localized such as the side of the chicken that is being fried in ioil.This kind of cooking can range from broiling in your oven to deep frying in a foot of oil.The key concept of dry heat cooking is that by letting the heat make contact with the food without extra moisture,it allows the food to brown and crisp while releasing sugars and proteins and enhancing the flavor of the food through the Maillard Reaction.</p>

					<h1>Sauteing & Pan-frying</h1>
					<p>Both methods are similar in that they require food to be cooked in a pan with fat.There,though,is where they stop mirroring each other.Sauteing(French for "jump")means to cook food at a very high heat with marginal amounts of fat while stirring and (for those more comfortable with this)tossing the pan repeatedly.Due to the high heat and small amounts of fat this technique poses a real danger of drying food out quickly;thus it is best suited for small cuts of food that can cook through without drying out,like shrimp,cubed veggies,and very small cuts of meat and fish.</p>
					<p>Pan-frying is when you cook a food in a pan at around the medium to mediuim high range in larger amounts of fat that reach to about half the height of the food item,turning once to ensure both sides are cooked well enough.This combination of increased moisture and reduced heat make pan-frying more suitable for larger pieces of foodstuff,as seen in its use in dishes such as pan-fried chicken,eggplant,or steak.This method allows larger pieces to be cooked through while still producing a browned and crispy exterior.</p>
					
					<h1>Roasting & Baking</h1>
					<p>Contemporary roasting and baking both cook food by bathing it in hot,dry air,uncovered.This almost always takes place inside an oven.</p>
					<!--<p>Delving further,roasting historically has been done over a fire used as an open-air heat source which required constant attention to rotation of the food(using a spit) to assure even cooking and browning.Today,outside of a camping trip,the most accurate version of old-school roasting is done with a rotisserie or individual skewers for kebabs.Most people don't have rotisseries,though,and kebabs don't do well with pieces of food larger than bite-sized,so if you're going to oven-roast something,to get the best results,you should flip(or stir and mix it around if it's small fooditems that are cooking)the food at intervals dependent upon the size of what you're cooking to ensure that all sides get crisp and also to prevent overcooking on one side.</p>-->
					<p>Roasting historically has been done over an open-air heat source(like a fire)while rotating on a spit to promote even browning and crisping and cooking while ensuring the juices of the food don't drip out and leave the food dry.Nowadays,roasting is typically done in an oven and without rotation(barring manually rotating the food or using a rotisserie).Therefore,the term 'roasting' has taken on a new definition: cooking any non-bread item in the oven,usually at temperatures in the 375-450 degrees farenheit range,that enter the oven pretty much in the same shape as they'll come out(therefore,excluding casseroles and other foods that have high amounts of 'empty space' in them).In order to preserve at least some of the tender,juicy interior and crispy exterior associated with open-fire roasting or using a rotisserie,I suggest that when oven-roasting meats,especially the larger cuts,either use a roasting pan,use bulkily-cut vegetables to form a bed beneath the meat,or just rotate it regularly during cooking.With cut-up vegetables and fruit that you're oven-roasting,just stir them around or,if they're whole,just rotate them regularly and you should be good.</p>
					<p>Baking usually refers to breads and other foods that traditionally wouldn't have been cooked on a roasting spit,but probably in the ashes of a dying fire or in hot stones or something like that.Common baked foods include pastries,muffins,cakes,bread loaves,as well as other completely different foods,like casseroles.In fact,you can label anything that contains high amounts of 'empty space' and lacks structure before being cooked in the oven as baked.</p>
				
					<h1>Grilling & Broiling</h1>
					<p>Grilling and broiling both cook foods by exposing them to extremely high heats(around 500 degrees farenheit).The main difference is that broiling applies the heat from above while grilling delivers heat from the bottom.</p>
					<p>Broiling takes place in an oven and works well for people who don't have a grill,for when it's too cold outside to grill efficiently,and any other reason that stops you from grilling.The main benefit of broiling is that it does really well with foods that cook quickly(like thinly cut vegetables and meats) so that you can focus on developing that nice exterior char without worrying about whether the insides are cooked well enough.That being said,however,when using thicker foods you really have to pay attention to how close the food is to the heat source and how fast its cooking,especially with meat if you want to avoid a perfectly charred,flavorful crust only serving to conceal the mushy,raw interior.</p>
					<p>Grilling takes place over a high-temperature heat source seperated from the food by a grated barrier(a grilling rack,anyone?).Grilling can also impart a smokier flavor depending on what kind of grill you use,plus if you're using a grated grill,nice grill marks will be present on the food.Grilling can also be utilized as a source of slow,indirect cooking by lighting one side of the grill with a low fire and placing the food on the unlit side,and then covering the grill.This ensures larger pieces of food develop a crust and cook thoroughly and tenderly.</p>
				
					<h1>Deep-Frying</h1>
					<p>Contrary to what some would believe,deep-frying is a dry-heat cooking mehtod.Take a piece of chicken,for example,and,assuming the oil has been heated sufficiently,place the chicken(which has been simply dredged in flour) in the oil.What happens now is that,upon hitting the hot oil,the water inside the chicken immediately starts to boil and release enormous amounts of steam which prevents the oil from being absorbed by or even touching the surface of the chicken.As the water continues to escape,the surface of the chicken(including the breading) dries out and crisps,the Maillard reaction,and a golden brown crust forms.The crust essentially acts as a steamer for the rest of the piece of chicken,the insides get tender and cooked while the crust fries to a crisp,perfect golden brown.</p>

					<h1>Moist Heat Cooking Methods</h1>
					<p>Moist heat cooking transfers the heat into a food item through moisture,which can be water,steam,wine,stock,and other water-based liquids,but not oil or melted fats which conflict with water.</p>
					<h1>Boiling</h1>
					<p>Water boils at 212 degrees farenheit,and when it reaches this temperature,its main distinction from simmering scalding and other heated water cooking methods is that bubbles should be forming and bursting at the surface of the water enthusiastically.When dealing with water of this temperature,it's best to use sturdy foods that will not break apart due to being tossed around in the ferociously rolling surface of the water(kind of like deep-frying and when you add poorly battered pieces of food and the coating is shaken completely off)or will become seriously altered in appearance,such as when milk curdles in soups and sauces when they're boiled.</p>
					<h1>Simmer</h1>
					<p>When water is just short of a full-blown boil at around 180 degrees farenheit or slightly higher bubbles start forming and rise to the surface of the water,and some steam may be present.This method is useful when braising or stewing due to less moisture loss due to evaporation or when you're cooking foods that don't take to boiling quite well or when you're warming leftover soups and stews.</p>
					<h1>Poaching</h1>
					<p>Cooking food in water in between 160-180 degrees farenheit is poaching.It is a very gentle way of cooking food in water and is very suitable for foods that would break apart in a boil or need to be cooked at slightly lower temperatures than simmering.The two most popular foods to poach are eggs and fish.</p>
					<!--<h1>Scalding</h1>
					<p>Water at around 150 degrees farenheit is suitable for scalding.During scalding small bubbles will be scattered across either the side or bottom(or both) of the saucepan,attached.Common uses for this technique include melting sugar,flour,chocolate,and other solids.</p>-->
					<h1>Steaming</h1>
					<p>The transfer of heat not through liquid water,but its vaporized version:steam.Once water begins to release any kind of steam(although most of the time people bring it to a full boil for this)you can place the food slightly above it,about an inch depending on the food,and the heat in the steam will cook it.Steaming is the gentlest moisture-based cooking method out there as the water never makes contact with the water,and its bubbles.A major benefit of steaming is that the food retains more nutrients than with any other cooking method anywhere as well as producing a finished product that is filled with moisture.</p>
					<h1>Stewing</h1>
					<p>The basest form of stewing is cooking a food in a liquid(other than fat)that is at about simmering temperature,but with less liquid than simmering so that the liquid can be used as a sauce.</p>
					<h1>Braising</h1>
					<p>Similar to a stew in that it involves simmering food in a controlled amount of liquid with the main difference being that,in stews,the meat is cut up into small chunks to be submerged in the cooking liquid.Most braises are used to tenderize tough cuts of meat or vegetables due to it being covered while simmering to trap moisture inside the dish:this also helps strengthen the flavors inside.Braises are often like soups and stews with their tendency to include a multitude of foods other than the main ingredient.</p>
